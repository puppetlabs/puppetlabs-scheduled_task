    desc <<-'EOT'
      One or more triggers defining when the task should run. A single trigger is
      represented as a hash, and multiple triggers can be specified with an array of
      hashes.

      A trigger can contain the following keys:

      * For all triggers:
          * `schedule` **(Required)** --- What kind of trigger this is.
            Valid values are `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, or `once`. Each kind
            of trigger is configured with a different set of keys; see the
            sections below. (`once` triggers only need a start time/date.)
          * `start_time` **(Required)** --- The time of day when the trigger should
            first become active. Several time formats will work, but we
            suggest 24-hour time formatted as HH:MM.
          * `start_date` ---  The date when the trigger should first become active.
            Defaults to the current date. You should format dates as YYYY-MM-DD,
            although other date formats may work. (Under the hood, this uses `Date.parse`.)
          * `minutes_interval` --- The repeat interval in minutes.
          * `minutes_duration` --- The duration in minutes, needs to be greater than the
            minutes_interval.
      * For `daily` triggers:
          * `every` --- How often the task should run, as a number of days. Defaults
            to 1. ("2" means every other day, "3" means every three days, etc.)
      * For `weekly` triggers:
          * `every` --- How often the task should run, as a number of weeks. Defaults
            to 1. ("2" means every other week, "3" means every three weeks, etc.)
          * `day_of_week` --- Which days of the week the task should run, as an array.
            Defaults to all days. Each day must be one of `mon`, `tues`,
            `wed`, `thurs`, `fri`, `sat`, `sun`, or `all`.
      * For `monthly` (by date) triggers:
          * `months` --- Which months the task should run, as an array. Defaults to
            all months. Each month must be an integer between 1 and 12.
          * `on` **(Required)** --- Which days of the month the task should run,
            as an array. Each day must be an integer between 1 and 31.
      * For `monthly` (by weekday) triggers:
          * `months` --- Which months the task should run, as an array. Defaults to
            all months. Each month must be an integer between 1 and 12.
          * `day_of_week` **(Required)** --- Which day of the week the task should
            run, as an array with only one element. Each day must be one of `mon`,
            `tues`, `wed`, `thurs`, `fri`, `sat`, `sun`, or `all`.
          * `which_occurrence` **(Required)** --- The occurrence of the chosen weekday
            when the task should run. Must be one of `first`, `second`, `third`,
            `fourth`, or `fifth`.
